# Gleidson Homepage
As I'm learning to code, I've built this homepage to exercise the concepts. Nothing fancy, just a funny way to put the learning into practice.


I do have some questions about privacy and security as I'm going, but I'm trying not to let this stop me for now.
Let me know if you have any feedback on how to make this code ["strong, better, faster"](https://youtu.be/gAjR4_CbPpQ).
