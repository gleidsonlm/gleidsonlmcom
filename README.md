# Gleidson Homepage
As I'm learning to code, I've built this homepage to exercise the concepts. Nothing fancy, but a funny way to put the learning in practice.
I do have some questions about privacy and security as I'm going, but I'm trying not letting this stop me now.
Let me know if you have any feedback how to make it this code "[strong, better, faster]"(https://youtu.be/gAjR4_CbPpQ).
